# 📊 Student Social Network Analysis

This project analyzes interaction patterns among students using **Social Network Analysis (SNA)** techniques.  
A real-world dataset was collected and modeled as a network to study relationships, influence, and structural patterns using centrality measures and graph visualizations.

---

## 🧠 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to:
- Understand how students are connected
- Identify influential or central individuals
- Discover hidden patterns in student interactions
- Visualize network structures and behaviors using graph theory

This project demonstrates practical application of SNA concepts on real data.
